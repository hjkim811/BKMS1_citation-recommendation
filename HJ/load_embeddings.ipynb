      "We propose an e-cient algorithm for esti- mation of possibility based qualitative ex- pected utility. It is useful for decision mak- ing mechanisms where each possible decision is assigned a multi-attribute possibility dis- tribution. The computational complexity of ordinary methods calculating the expected utility based on discretization is growing ex- ponentially with the number of attributes, and may become infeasible with a high num- ber of these attributes. We present series of theorems and lemmas proving the correct- ness of our algorithm that exibits a linear computational complexity. Our algorithm has been applied in the context of selecting the most prospective partners in multi-party multi-attribute negotiation, and can also be used in making decisions about potential of- fers during the negotiation as other similar problems.\n",
